# 🚘 SARATHI – Unified Attention Monitoring for Transportation

> "A moment’s lapse. A lifetime lost. SARATHI watches, warns, and saves."

---

## 📍 Overview

**SARATHI** is a real-time AI-based driver and pilot attention monitoring system that **detects drowsiness**, **unsafe posture**, and **inattentiveness** using only a single webcam. It serves as a **digital co-pilot**, ensuring that no fatigue-related accident goes unnoticed.

Developed during **Hack4Bengal 4.0** – Eastern India's Largest Hackathon, SARATHI addresses one of the deadliest causes of transport-related deaths — **fatigue**.

## 🧪 Technical Workflow

SARATHI performs **attention analysis** using:
- 👁 **Eye landmarks** to detect prolonged closure or gaze shifts
- 🧠 **Head pose** (pitch, yaw, roll) to monitor orientation
- 🧍 **Posture deviation** using shoulder & spine angles

🧠 **If any threshold is crossed**:
- Screenshot is captured
- Audio alarm is triggered
- Visual status bar updates on Streamlit UI

---

## 🧗‍♂ Challenges Faced

- ⚠ Real-time processing without GPU
- 🌙 Handling low-light conditions
- ❗ Ensuring accuracy while minimizing false alarms
- 📐 Angle-sensitive posture detection
- 🧠 Calibrating thresholds across multiple face orientations

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- 📷 **Dual camera setup** (side + front view) using IoT (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- 🧘 **User posture calibration** on startup for custom thresholds
- ✋ **Gesture-based alert dismissal** using hand detection
- 🚨 **SOS Trigger**: Auto-message if alert persists beyond limit
- 🌒 **Night mode** via IR camera support

## 🕉 Why the Name "SARATHI"?

In ancient Indian tradition, **SARATHI** means “charioteer” — the one who safely drives the warrior through chaos.  
In our context, SARATHI acts as a **modern digital guide**, **monitoring attentiveness**, **preventing fatigue**-induced danger, and **saving lives** through intelligence.
